Mama Bear ran through the stalls, out of breath and with tears in her eyes.  
> "Have you seen a little bear cub, honey-colored fur, with a blue scarf?"  
She asked every vendor, every passerby, but they all shook their heads.

The market, which before had seemed cheerful and lively, now was a chaotic labyrinth for her.  
The noise of voices, the smell of warm bread — everything had turned into a confusing blur.  
The thought that Cirillo was alone and frightened squeezed her heart like a vice.

Meanwhile, Cirillo walked slowly beside the big dark bear.  
He had decided not to resist, but he felt that something was wrong.  
That bear spoke little, and when he did, it was with a cold voice.

> "So, are you coming? We don’t want to keep waiting," said the bear, reaching out a paw.

Cirillo stepped back.  
“I… I have to find my mom…” he murmured in a trembling voice.

The bear frowned, but before he could say anything else, a familiar and powerful voice broke through the noise of the market:  
> "MY SON! WHERE HAVE YOU GONE?"

Cirillo turned around suddenly.  
Mama Bear was running toward him, arms open, her face streaked with tears.  
In an instant, the little cub tore himself away from the bad bear and threw himself into her arms.

“Mama! Mama!” cried Cirillo, hugging her tightly.  
“I’ll never leave you again, I promise! I was so scared… I’ll be good, I swear!”

Mama Bear held him close, stroking his head.  
> "It’s all right, my little one. The important thing is that you’re safe."

The big bear, seeing that scene, stepped back and disappeared into the crowd.  
Mama took Cirillo’s paw, and together they headed home, away from the noise of the market.

And that evening, under his warm blanket, Cirillo remembered the most important lesson of his life:  
**when you are little, you must never wander away from your mother.**
