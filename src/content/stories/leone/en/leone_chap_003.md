The young lion ran through the trees, his heartbeat pounding in his ears louder than his own breath.
He had never felt so afraid.

The voices of the men had suddenly echoed in the forest: harsh, rough, like thunder ready to strike.
The kidnappers spoke among themselves, laughing cruelly, and every sound of their words chilled the lion's blood.

He had promised the girl to help her, and yet... he had chosen to run away.

He ran for a long time, without looking back, until he found himself in a clearing lit by the moon. He stopped, panting, breathless, his tail low.
He felt small, smaller than he had ever been.
A coward.

He closed his eyes, and in the darkness of his mind he heard his mother's voice:
— Never trust men, my son. They are dangerous. Always flee from them. —
Then his father's stern voice:
— A wise lion does not risk himself for men. Their hearts are dark. Never forget that. —

Those words had been repeated to him since he was a cub. And now, in fear, they seemed right.
"I did well to run away... I did well..." he repeated to himself.

But just then, another sound struck him, stronger than the voices of his parents in his mind.
It was an echo stretching into the silence of the forest.
A cry.

— Help! Help! —
It was the girl's voice.

The young lion perked up his ears. His heart leapt. Every tear the little girl shed seemed to fall inside him like drops of fire.
