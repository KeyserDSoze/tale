Night fell swiftly over the forest.
The hut where Amara was locked up sank into darkness, and outside, the shadows of the trees stretched like great silent guardians. The wind rustled through the leaves, and in that air of mystery distant calls could be heard: an owl singing, the crack of branches broken by some animal, the deep breath of the night.

Amara curled up in a corner, hugging her knees. She was tired of crying, but she couldn’t stop trembling.
— Mom… Dad… where are you? — she whispered softly, her voice barely audible.

It was then that she heard a different sound. Not the heavy steps of men, but a soft, padded tread, drawing closer little by little.
A rustle in the grass.
A shadow moving with grace.

Amara held her breath, her eyes wide open. Then, out of the dim light, two glowing eyes appeared, golden as molten metal. Eyes she had never seen before, eyes that shone like two little moons.

From the darkness emerged a young lion. His mane was short and soft, his paws strong but not yet fully grown, and his gaze… his gaze was not fierce, but curious.

Amara stiffened: she knew lions were the kings of the forest, powerful and terrifying. But this one did not look like a hungry monster. He drew closer, until his muzzle was near the crack in the hut.

And, as if in a dream, he spoke.
— Why are you crying, little one? — he asked in a deep but gentle voice.

Amara’s mouth fell open: a lion that spoke! She thought it must be her imagination, yet those words were real, warm like a breath of wind upon her face.
— They took me away… — she answered between sobs. — They locked me here… I’ll never see my family again.

The lion tilted his head, as if thinking. He had never spoken to a human being. In his mind, men had always been seen as dangerous and cruel. That was what his father and mother had taught him, and that was what he had always believed. But this girl did not seem wicked. She was fragile, lost, with eyes full of tears.

— I… I will help you — he murmured at last, almost surprised by his own words.

Amara looked at him in wonder, a spark of hope flickering in her heart. For a moment, she forgot her fear.
— Do you promise? — she asked in a trembling voice.

The young lion took a step back, lifted his gaze to the moon, and then fixed his eyes on hers again.
— I promise — he said firmly.

Then a sudden rustle made him start: it was the footsteps of the kidnappers returning to the hut.
The lion tensed, his heart pounding. With a swift leap, he vanished among the trees, swallowed by the darkness of the forest.

Amara remained there, her heart thundering in her chest. She didn’t know whether it had been a dream or reality, but inside her, something had changed. For the first time since she had been taken, she felt she was no longer alone.
Somewhere out there, a young lion had promised to return.
