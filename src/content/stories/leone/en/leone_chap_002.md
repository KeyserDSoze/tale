Night fell swiftly over the forest.
The hut where Amara was locked away sank into darkness, and outside, the shadows of the trees stretched like great silent guardians. The wind rustled the leaves, and in that mysterious air distant calls could be heard: an owl singing, the crack of branches broken by some animal, the deep breath of the night.

Amara curled up in a corner, hugging her knees. She was tired of crying, but she could not stop trembling.
— Mama... Papa... where are you? — she whispered softly, her voice barely a thread.

Then she heard a different sound. Not heavy footsteps like those of men, but a soft, padded step, approaching slowly.
A rustle in the grass.
A shadow moving with elegance.

Amara held her breath, eyes wide. Then, from the gloom, two bright eyes appeared, molten gold in color. Eyes she had never seen before, eyes that shone like two small moons.

From the darkness emerged a young lion. His mane was short and soft, his paws strong but still youthful, and his gaze... his gaze was not fierce, but curious.

Amara stiffened: she knew lions were the kings of the forest, powerful and fearsome. But this one did not seem like a hungry monster. He approached slowly, until his muzzle was close to the crack in the hut.

And, as if in a dream, he spoke.
— Why are you crying, little one? — he asked, his voice deep but gentle.

Amara's mouth fell open: a lion that spoke! She thought it was her imagination, yet those words were real, warm as a breath of wind on her face.
— They took me away... — she replied between sobs. — They locked me here... I will never see my family again.

The lion tilted his head, as if thinking. He had never spoken to a human before. In his mind, humans had always been seen as dangerous and cruel. That was what his father and mother had taught him, and that was what he had always believed. But this girl did not seem bad. She was fragile, lost, her eyes full of tears.

— I... I will help you — he murmured at last, almost surprised by his own words.

Amara looked at him in amazement, a glimmer of hope in her heart. For a moment, she forgot her fear.
— Do you promise? — she asked, her voice trembling.

The young lion took a step back, looked up at the moon, then returned his gaze to hers.
— I promise — he said firmly. — But not now. I must understand how. I must find the courage.

Then a sudden rustle made him jump: it was the footsteps of the kidnappers returning to the hut.
The lion tensed, his heart pounding. With a quick leap, he disappeared among the trees, swallowed by the darkness of the forest.

Amara remained there, her heart pounding in her chest. She did not know if it had been a dream or reality, but something inside her had changed. For the first time since she had been taken, she felt she was no longer alone.
Somewhere out there, a young lion had promised to return.
