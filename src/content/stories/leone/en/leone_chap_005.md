Dawn was about to break. The sky was tinged with pink and gold, and the first rays of sun filtered through the leaves of the forest. The kidnappers came out of the hut: speaking in low voices, determined to move the girl before anyone discovered them.
Amara, with tired eyes full of fear, was dragged by the arm along the path.

But behind a bush, three pairs of eyes shone.
Merlin, Morgana, and Arthur were ready.

— Now — whispered Merlin, and the three cats suddenly leapt out.

With agile and quick movements, they began to run in front of the men, tails high and eyes provocative. Morgana let out long, mysterious meows, Arthur stopped and started as if to challenge them, while Merlin led his siblings with cunning.

— Look! Big, well-fed cats! — shouted one of the kidnappers. — If we catch them, we'll have meat for days!
And without a second thought, the three men began to chase the darting little shadows.

The girl was left alone, her hands still tied. Her heart was pounding wildly. She didn't understand what was happening, but she felt that something was changing.

It was then that **the young lion** emerged from the bushes.
His mane shone in the dawn light, and in his eyes there was no more hesitation.
— I have returned — he said, calm but strong.

Amara looked at him in disbelief. — I knew it... I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

The lion approached slowly, grabbed the ropes with his teeth and, with a determined bite, broke them. The fibers crumbled and the girl's hands were finally free.

— Let's run — he said.

Together they ventured into the forest, away from the path. The trees seemed to open to their passage, as if to protect them. The air smelled of freedom, and every step took them further from the darkness of captivity.

Further ahead, among the branches, the three cats awaited them, panting but happy.
